# Sociocultural

While Creative Commons provides licenses written in legal language, the practice of sharing and reuse is grounded in a social and cultural context that contends we can be more successful in a commons of openness.

The Sociocultural module has four units of learning that can help you understand the social and cultural issues of openness so you can advocate for it in your own work.

On completion of these  units the [final summit quest](sociocultural-summit-quest.md) combines learning from across all  units into one final assignment for the whole module.
