# How the Open Model is Better

How do you convince the people who you work with to openly share their work when their response is “Why would I give away what I made for free?”

## The Big Question

Most of our intuition towards the value of things we create and do are based upon economic models of controlling distribution; something gains value because of its scarcity. When goods are digitized, the costs of replicating them shrink to near zero. Yet we hang on to the perception that the value of our creative works are in the digital item themselves, rather than the context of services and non-digital goods that can be a companion to the sharing economy.

Additionally, the benefits of open sharing are not always generated at the point of sharing. Being able to make a case for open licensing is not limited to the virtue of sharing; there are economic, efficiency, efficacy, and opportunity cases to be made. Real world examples from multiple sectors support the idea of how openness can be a positive gain for the work you do. 

## Learning Outcomes

* Champion open models that support community goals / strategies
* Identify open movements and their values
* Articulate the values (beyond cost savings) of Open
* Communicate benefits of sharing for different sectors
* Give examples of Creative Commons impact
* Convince someone to use / adopt Creative Commons


## Personal Reflection / Why It Matters to You  
  
Think about how much information is freely available to you for your professional or personal interests, just by typing a question into a box marked “search”. What if each time you went online to check the weather, look up the location of the nearest  bookstore, checked the news about your football team required a fee or a special access password? 

Then take into account the information you do have access to freely is actually a fraction of information that is created in the world. Is it fair that knowledge created with public funds is not available to the public? Might society globally benefit if all information truly was free? 

## Acquiring Essential Knowledge 

### On Openness

Published in 2011 by Creative Commons and available in 9 languages, [The Power of Open](http://thepowerofopen.org/) provides case studies of success in open practices by not only artists, but news providers, scientists, publishers, museums, and more. The [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/) advocates for openness and the societal gains of sharing knowledge.

Don Tapscott’s [TED Talk Four Principles for the Open World](https://www.ted.com/talks/don_tapscott_four_principles_for_the_open_world_1) outlines how collaboration, transparency, sharing, and empowerment can make a world not only better for society, but also business. The Open Data Initiative offers [How to Make a Business Case for Open Data](https://theodi.org/guides/how-make-business-case-open-data). See also the [points outlined in Project Open](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/business-case/).

### Open Movements

[Open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) is cited as the first place where networked open sharing produced a tangible benefit as [a movement that went much further than technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_movement). The [Conversation's Explainer overview of other movements](http://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-the-open-movement-10308) adds as other examples, [Open Innovation](http://corporateinnovation.berkeley.edu/) in the corporate world, [Open Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) (e.g. [Open Data Commons](http://opendatacommons.org/) and [Opendata.ch](https://opendata.ch/)) and [Crowdsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing). 

Governments, from [national](https://www.data.gov/open-gov/), [state](https://www.data.gov/states/), and [city](https://www.data.gov/cities/) level have found value in sharing information and providing services to citizens. 

The [Open Access movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) aims to make research widely available, most notably when it is funded by public moneys, led by journals such as the [Public Library of Science](https://www.plos.org/). In the realm of the broader [Open Science movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science), look for examples from numerous research studies that demonstrate [The Value of Openness in Scientific Problem Solving](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/07-050.pdf).  Review the presentation on [Benefits and Practice of Open Science](http://www.slideshare.net/sjDCC/benefits-and-practice-of-open-science) for more insight.

### Open Education

While mostly associated with open content e.g. the pioneering work of [MIT OpenCourseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/) and growing interest in [Open Educational Resources](https://www.oercommons.org/) and [Open Textbooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_textbook), the idea of Open Education more broad concepts such as providing education to all citizens (e.g. [UNESCO’s Education for All](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/education-for-all/)), open access to formal and informal learning, pedagogy, research, and learning data. 

The UK’s [Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk/) began with a mission of education for all, and while economics conditions have forced a narrowing of that scope, there are more than [100 Open Universities around the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_universities). 

To learn more about Open Education, read Tony Bates’s [What do We Mean by ‘open’ in Education](http://www.tonybates.ca/2015/02/16/what-do-we-mean-by-open-in-education/) and David Wiley’s [What is Open Pedagogy?](https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2975)


## Application of Learning

### Learner Toolkit

Use the case studies from [The Power of Open](http://thepowerofopen.org/) or any other examples from the Acquiring Knowledge section to find an example of openness in a field closest to the kind of work you do. Add to your Learner Toolkit the name, and link, and notes on how the same rationale could work in your field. Then, do the same for an example that is far from yours (e.g. if you work on social services, look at an example from business). See if you can find a reason for openness that might be translated to your world.


### Community - Collaboration, Appreciation, Recognition, Gratitude

In the CC Certificate social forum post at least 5 barriers to openness that you hear from the people you work with. Ask for help with the most difficult one. Then respond to at least 3 others posts with examples or rationales you can think of from your research or experience.


### Applied Practice

Complete one of the following activities in the Quest Bank. Now share it in person with one or more of your colleagues. Add the link to your Toolkit along with notes on the response you got. How many are you able to convince?

* [Make a 3 minute elevator pitch for openness in video or audio format](https://quests.creativecommons.org/assignments/elevator-pitch-open-better)
