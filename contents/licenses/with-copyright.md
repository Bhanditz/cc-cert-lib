# How Licenses Work with Copyright

Creative Commons licenses are not alternatives to copyright law; they function wholly inside of copyright law. 


## The Big Question

Everyone is a creator, everyone holds copyright. 

You doodle in your notebook in a meeting, you take a holiday photo on your phone. Copyright requires all rights reserved, and as a creator you have and binary answer for useage yes or no.  Creative Commons licenses are not an alternative to copyright. *They work alongside copyright and enable creators to modify copyright terms to best suit their needs and desires to share.*

Think about the history of how books have been published and distributed. From clay tablets, to papryus to monks with their elaborate codices. With the [Gutenberg press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) invented in 1440 we celebrate the book entering industrial age and mass production possible. By the 19th century a book published was an established professions.  The publisher duty has been the selection, preparation, and marketing and distribution.

Imagine you’ve written a novel. You’ve printed a few copies for friends to read and they’ve loved it. You’re excited to get the novel out to the world so that millions of others can come to love your characters like you do (and so that you can make some money). There’s just one problem - copyright gives you the exclusive right to make and distribute copies of your novel, and you have no idea how to mass produce, market, and distribute your book the world.

One way to solve this problem is to find a publisher who does know how to do these things and give them permission to copy and distribute your novel on your behalf. The way a copyright holder grants someone else these kinds of permissions is by means of a license. A license typically specifies what the person or organization receiving the permissions must do in return for the permissions (e.g., how much you are to be paid for each book sold) and the specific things the person receiving the license is and is not allowed to do (e.g., they can make and sell copies of your book, but they cannot change the ending or make a movie based on the book). A copyright holder can grant different permissions to different people or organizations via different licenses if they wish. For example, you could give one publisher a license to carry out print sales and a second publisher permission to sell an audiobook version. Copyright grants you a legal monopoly on these kinds of activities. Licenses are how you grant them to others.


Additionally, when you are using a work that is an adaptation of one or more pre-existing works, you may need to give credit to the creator(s) of the pre-existing work(s), in addition to giving credit to the creator of the adaptation. If you are unsure, you should either contact the rights holder for clarification, or search for works that permit commercial uses. All licenses after version 1.0 also allow you to license your contributions under a later version of the same license, and some also allow ported licenses. 

Some examples of collecting societies include [ASCAP](https://www.ascap.com/) and [BMI](https://www.bmi.com/) (United States), [BUMA/STEMRA](https://www.bumastemra.nl/) (Netherlands), [PRS](http://www.prsformusic.com) (United Kingdom), and [APRA](http:/apraamcos.com.au) (Australia). You may apply a 4.0 Creative Commons license to material subject to any of those rights, whether or not the material is also subject to copyright.

Often, the database provider is not the original author of the database contents. However, we do not recommend this. (See above for more detail about how past versions of CC licenses vary with respect to **sui generis** database rights.) They provide basic information, sometimes about fairly complex topics, and will often link to more detailed information. If you do, you should take additional care to mark the adaptation as involving multiple copyrights under different terms so that downstream users are aware of their obligations to comply with the licenses from all rights holders.

Be sure to confirm that the material you want to use is actually under a CC license, as search results may sometimes be misleading. All of the ported licenses are at version 3.0 or earlier, which means licensors using those licenses do not have the benefit of the improvements made in the 4.0 license suite. All CC licenses require users to attribute the creator of licensed material, unless the creator has waived that requirement, not supplied a name, or asked that her name be removed. Unless you have a specific reason to use a ported license, we suggest you consider using one of the international licenses. CC offers some additional information on [how CC licenses may affect your moral rights](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/4.0/Moral_rights).

## Personal Reflection / Why It Matters to You  
  
Have you ever created something - a picture, a video, a bit of writing - that you wanted to share with others and that you wanted them to share with their friends too? What was it? Why did you want to share rather than protect it? 

##### Discuss It

*In the CC Cert Discussion Community (or elsewhere) share a story about the item you shared with a specific set of friends or colleagues. How and where did you share? Describe what it was and why you were comfortable sharing it without any kind of protection or control?*


## Acquiring Essential Knowledge 

Just a few decades ago, creators needed the help of intermediaries, such as record labels, collecting societies  and publishers, to put their creative work out into the world. With the advent of the digital revolution and the Internet, it is now possible to distribute works in a variety of formats of a high, often professional quality; to work collaboratively across contexts; and to create new, derivative or collective works—on a global level, in a decentralised manner, and at comparatively low cost. 


### The Purpose of the Creative Commons Licenses

For a brief reminder of the goals of Creative Commons, watch the short video [A Shared Culture](https://creativecommons.org/about/videos/a-shared-culture/).

[![A Shared Culture video screenshot](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-cert-core/blob/master/images/licenses/shared-culture-video.jpg "A Shared Culture video screenshot")](https://creativecommons.org/about/videos/a-shared-culture/)

*[A Shared Culture](https://creativecommons.org/about/videos/a-shared-culture/) by [Jesse Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Dylan) licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/)*

Creative Commons helps you legally share your knowledge and creativity to build a more equitable, accessible, and innovative world, as described on the [Creative Commons About page](https://creativecommons.org/about/). Specifically, Creative Commons licenses remove the friction involved in sharing creative works in a world where everything is automatically copyrighted. Creative Commons provides [easy to use tools](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) for selecting and applying open licenses to your creative works. 

However, before applying a Creative Commons license to your work, there are [several things you should consider](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees). You should carefully read and ponder each of the items on this list of things to consider.



### The Relationship Between Creative Commons and Copyright

Creative Commons licenses are copyright licenses (see [an example](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)). In other words, **Creative Commons licenses are legal instruments by which a copyright holder grants permissions to others, as long as those others abide by certain requirements described in the licenses** - like the requirement to provide attribution to the author of the original work. Some people mistakenly believe that Creative Commons licenses are an alternative to copyright law. This is untrue. Creative Commons licenses function wholly inside of copyright law. 

For this reason, Creative Commons licenses do not (and cannot) affect rights available to people through [exceptions or limitations to copyright law](../copyright/exceptions-limitations.md), like Fair Use or Fair Dealing. No condition of a Creative Commons can limit your Fair Use or Fair Dealing rights. For example, a derivative work that would be legal to create from a traditionally copyrighted work under Fair Use would also be legal to create from a work licensed with Creative Commons license containing a No Derivatives condition. 

### Creative Commons Licenses are Irrevocable

See for example  Section 2.a.1 of the [CC Attribution licese legal code)(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) -- Section 2 is "Scope" and the first item is "License grant":

> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

> A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

> B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

An irrevocable license is highly desirable from the perspective of the users of works with Creative Commons licenses, because they can be confident knowing that the creator can’t arbitrarily pull back the rights granted them under the Creative Commons licenses. 

However, this makes the choice to apply a Creative Commons license to a creative work a very serious matter for the copyright holder. Once the work is published under a Creative Commons license, those rights and permissions granted to the public cannot be taken back.

### When Creative Commons Licenses Don’t Apply

Creative Commons licenses are only necessary when you want to provide people with one or more of the permissions governed by copyright law. For example, if you want to give others permissions to freely copy and redistribute your work, you should use a Creative Commons license to grant them that permission. Likewise, if you want to give others permission to freely transform, alter, or otherwise create derivative works based on your work, you should use a Creative Commons license to grant them that permission.
 
However, you don’t need to use a Creative Commons license to give someone permission to read your article or watch your video, because reading and watching aren’t activities that copyright regulates. You also don’t need to use a Creative Commons license to give people permission to link to your website, because linking isn’t covered by copyright. 

For more information, see Section 8.a (Section 8 is "Interpretation") of the [Attribution License legal code](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode):

> For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.

##### For Your Personal Learning Toolkit
*Explore the details of one of a [Creative Commons License legal code](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode). Add a link to the legal code to your toolkit and questions or notes about specific sections that might be pertinent to your work or creative interests.*
