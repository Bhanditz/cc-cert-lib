# The Commons

The commons has long played a historical role in making cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society. 

Creative Commons is part of that long tradition complementing the historical local and natural resource based commons with a contemporary global digital commons. Understanding the commons and how it works is essential to successfully using Creative Commons.

The Commons module has four units of learning that provide a grounding in the commons and Creative Commons role in stewarding and supporting it.


1. [Significance of the Commons](significance.md) - What is the history of the idea of a Commons and how is it manifested in the world today?
2. [Physical and Digital Commons](physical-digital.md) - Explore the similarities and differences between physical and digital commons.
3. [The Commons Opportunity](opportunity.md) - How can society benefit from a thriving commons?
4. [The Creative Commons Organization](creative-commons.md) - Understand Creative Commons role in supporting and stewarding the digital commons.

On completion of these four units the [final summit quest](commons-summit-quest.md) combines learning from across all four units into one final assignment for the whole module.
