# Commons Module Summit Quest

Now that you have completed the units in this module, the Summit Quest is your opportunity to demonstrate your applied understanding of the commons .

As a review this summit question will draw upon your knowledge of these units:


1. [Significance of the Commons](significance.md) - What is the history of the idea of a Commons and how is it manifested in the world today?
2. [Physical and Digital Commons](physical-digital.md) - Explore the similarities and differences between physical and digital commons.
3. [The Commons Opportunity](opportunity.md) - How can society benefit from a thriving commons?
4. [The Creative Commons Organization](creative-commons.md) - Understand Creative Commons role in supporting and stewarding the digital commons.

As you conclude the commons portion of the CC Certification, bring together everything you’ve learned about commons as you answer the following questions:

1. Identify a commons in which you participate. Does it have a name? How do those who participate in this commons refer to it?
2. Describe the shared resource(s) the commons is formed around. Would you consider these resources to be [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good) or [common pool resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-pool_resource)? Are they physical or digital resources?
3. Who are the other commoners (participants in this commons)? How do they benefit from their participation in the commons? What leads them to be concerned about the sustainability of the shared resource(s) you described above?
4. What is the biggest threat to the long-term viability of this commons? Is enclosure a possibility? Why or why not?
5. What norms or rules have the commoners established for participation in the commons? How do they compare to [Ostrom’s eight principles for managing a commons](http://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons)?
6. Knowing what you know now about commons, how they function, and the risks they face, what improvements could be made to the commons you identified above in order to improve it’s chances of long-term sustainability?
