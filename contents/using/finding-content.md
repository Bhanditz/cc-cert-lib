# Finding CC Licensed Content

If it exists, there should be an open verision of it.

## The Big Question

Understanding the basics Creative Commons is not only about how licenses fit into copyright system or how they support social norms for digital commons. It’s also about very practical approach, ease of use and usability of those digital commons. That is why proper attribution and searchability of CC content are extremely important.

## Learning Outcomes

* Identify sources of Creative Commons licensed content 
* Use Creative Commons Search tool 
* Explore Google and other means of search   
* Make use of search filters to browse and find content by license

## Personal Reflection / Why It Matters to You  
  
What kinds of resources do you seek for your professional/personal use? Where do you currently turn to for new resources? Are they open or do they have openly licensed equivalents? What tools and features are are important for you when searching for digital content?

## Acquiring Essential Knowledge 



### General search tools

There are many tools that can help you search for CC licensed content. Perhaps one of the most helpful is the [Creative Commons search tool](https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/). You can add CC search to your browser and search using a variety of repositories and sources (from photos from 500px and Flickr to public domain resources from many museums).

Although the CC search tool pulls from Google as well, you can use Google’s advanced search tool for license specified content too. Google has a great blog post on how to use the tool effectively. Be careful though, many images and websites can be marked with CC license by the image itself can be an exception. It is always recommended to check the source if possible. 

When using general search engines and sites with different licenses available you will often see different types of filters. Some of them use names of the licenses and filter for content under specific licenses but some, for example CC search will ask you if you need a results to modify, adapt, build upon. Using only this will give you all results with content licensed without Non Derivative condition, if you want use your material for commercial purpose or to combine this with other materials under free licenses you will have to turn on another filter which is “use for commercial purposes”. Take a moment to check how those filters work in your prefered search tool.


### Looking for perfect photos, videos and music

Many websites either house exclusively openly licensed content, such as Wikipedia. Other websites that can be effective for teaching purposes have specific filtering tools that will allow you to search for CC licensed content.
YouTube allows users to publish under CC BY license but does not offer easy way to search for those videos. 
Services like [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/) and [500px](https://500px.com/creativecommons) for photos and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/creativecommons ) for videos offer their users all licenses to choose from.

There is also a growing number of websites focused on one type of content like vector graphics (for example The Noun Project) or specific conditions like only using CC Zero mechanism (like Unsplash and Pixabay for photos and Pexels for photos and videos). They all offer specific features and are designed for different users in mind. 

For more websites with CC licensed conetnt for general use check this [list from BC Campus Open Textbook project](https://opentextbc.ca/opentextbook/chapter/find-openly-licensed-content/).


### In search for scientific and educational content 

Many scientific and educational repositories use CC licenses but are not visible in main search engines. If you are looking for subject specific content it might be easier to find an expert source from your field (or language). 
For more CC licensed resources check:
*[List of scientific webistes with resources published under CC licenses](https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/open-science/science-resources/)  
*[Open Education Databease list webistes and tools with  Open Educational Resources](http://oedb.org/ilibrarian/80-oer-tools/).

## Application of Learning

### Learner Toolkit
Select two or three resources directly relevant to your personal or work-related CC needs from the Acquiring Essential Knowledge content and add them to your personal Creative Commons toolkit. Adding them to your toolkit makes them easy to find and use when the need arises, and makes it easy for you to pass on resources you consider important to others. Annotate the resources with notes explaining why they are relevant and important for you and your work.

### Community - Collaboration, Appreciation, Recognition, Gratitude
Post a story about how you benefited from someone who chose to share their creative works under a Creative Commons license in the CC Certificate social forum. Alternatively, share a description of (and link to, if applicable) a community that engages in commons-based peer production that others might not be aware of.
