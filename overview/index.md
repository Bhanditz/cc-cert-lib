## Why Needed?
Librarians have always been keepers and distributors of knowledge. In the 21st century their role is expanding in new ways. Library collections are increasingly digital. The copyright expertise librarians have is being complemented with open [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) based advances. 

Libraries are adding makerspaces, learning labs, 3D printing, and digital media studios to their traditional collections of books and periodicals. In this new, more digital environment, librarians have a critical role to play enhancing the media literacy of their patrons, from kids to scientists. 

The CC Librarian Certificate aims to ensure all librarians have the 21st century knowledge and skills they need to successfully perform Creative Commons related library functions and help patrons extend access to knowledge.
